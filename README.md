# Chameleon 

## Features
**Chameleon is a grid type orthogonal keyboard with two optional layouts in one single PCB.** Being able to break off the bottom row allows both a 5x12 layout similar to the popular Preonic and a 4x12 layout similar to the equally popular little brother Planck on the same PCB. 

Using the more common 19.05 mm grid spacing (vs Preonic & Planck's unique 19 mm) this PCB fit's several popular 'aftermarket' keyboard cases intended for JJ40/JJ50 and BM40 PCB's without modification. (Please read below!)

Being fully hot-swap and with PCB mounted stabilizers, Chameleon adds support for up to four encoders and a bottom row allowing either a single stabilized 2u key or two 2u keys in the middle, allowing for a layout that suits most users. If used as a 5 row keyboard, the bottom encoders can alternatively be placed at the edges on the second row, but **not more than one per corner.** 

The Chameleon features 8 bottomfacing RGB LEDs for underglow effects or to be used for layer indication or similar. 

**Please Note! This PCB does NOT fit a Planck/Preonic case! You will need a different case to complete the build!**

### Main Features:
* QMK and VIAL compatible, fully programmable keyboard**
* RP2040 MCU, Dual-core Arm Cortex M0+ processor, flexible clock running up to 133 MHz
* 264KB of SRAM, and 4MB of on-board Flash memory
* USB-C connector, (USB 1.1 device and host support)
* Low-power sleep and dormant modes
* Drag-and-drop programming using mass storage over USB
* Kaihl hot-swap sockets for Cherry MX compatible switches (3 & 5-pin)
* Cherry Style PCB mounted stabilizers
* Two main layouts:
	* 5x12 with 58 to 60 keys
	* 4x12 with 46 to 48 keys (Break off bottom row) 
* Configurable bottom row:
	* Full 1u grid
	* 1x centered, stabilized 2u key
	* 2x centered,  stabilized 2u keys

### Optional add-ons:
* Support for up to 4 rotary encoders **(one encoder per corner)**
* Optional RGB underglow (8x SK6812 mini-e)
* FR4 Front plate (FR4 material, same as PCB), with full layout options (Black / White). This is designed to fit most/all existing cases of a tray (or burger) mounting type, 3D printed or CNC. Se below for listed tested cases.

**These options requires additional components not included in this listing and sold separately.**

## Assembly
**Little or no tools at all needed!** The PCB can be delivered fully soldered and ready to use, either as a full matrix, or with your selection of rotary encoders (encoders need to be added to the order), or as a "DIY Kit" with the hotswap sockets for the 6 encoder positions not soldered.

The 8 optional RGB LED's needs to be soldered in place if used. (These are pre-soldered together with the encoders/hot-swap sockets at no extra cost, if that option is selected and all parts are purchased in the same order).

# Case & Plate
**The design is made to fit any existing cases for JJ40/JJ50 & BM40 both CNC and 3D printed.** This means that existing cases with an *integrated* plate is then limited to the layout options supported by that case/plate even if the PCB supports more layouts.

*Mounting hardware is associated with the case, and not delivered with the Chameleon PCB and Plate.

## Front Plate
**A front plate in FR4 (PCB core material) is available as an add-on, but may not fit all cases.** To be as much a "one size fit's all" plate, this plate has rounded corners, which may leave gaps in the corners on some cases.

## Sandwich type case/plates
A full sandwich type case in FR4 material will be added at a later date for those interested, but is for now WIP.

** Firmware pending
